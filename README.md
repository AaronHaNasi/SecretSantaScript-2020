# SecretSantaScript-2020
A digital secret santa drawing script that provides anonymity (provided the person running the script is trustworthy!)

I wrote this in about 15 minutes for a one off secret Santa event among friends. The concept is very simple; basically it writes a name to a text file. The text file is sent to the person who then opens it and reads the name inside to determine the person they must get a gift for.
